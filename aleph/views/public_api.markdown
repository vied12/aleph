# Aleph Search API

## Introduction

The Aleph API enables you to search for corporate filings from extractives companies

## Endpoints

The api is available at https://search.openoil.net/aleph_api/1/

Currently the only supported request is searching through documents, at

https://search.openoil.net/aleph_api/1/query

## Request Format

The following parameters are available:

 - q -- search terms, using the elasticsearch-based syntax described
at http://search.openoil.net/help
 - offset, limit -- for paging of results
 - source -- which document bases to include

## Result format

The API will return a JSON dictionary. The most important item wihin it is 'results'. This contains a list of matches, each of which is a dictionary with the following items:

- archive_url: a link to our cached copy of the document
- collection: which of our document bases the document is from
- source_url: original source (e.g. on the regulator website). 
- title: document title
- score: how well the document matches the search query, as measured by elasticsearch
- updated_at: when Aleph downloaded the document


## Python example

Using python, we can get a list of documents from Australian-listed companies talking about out-of-court settlements:

```python
import requests

req = requests.get(
    'https://search.openoil.net/aleph_api/1/query',
    params={
        'q': '"settled out of court"',
        'source': 'asx',
        })

for result in req.json()['results']:
    print(result['title'])

```

Output is:

```
